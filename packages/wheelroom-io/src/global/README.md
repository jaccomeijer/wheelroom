# Global

The 'global' folder contains React views and styles.

## Global views

Global views are React components that are used more than once. If a react
component is used only once, the best place is the same folder as where it is
used.

## Global styles

Global styles are used more than once. If a style is used only once, the best
place is the same folder as where it is used.
