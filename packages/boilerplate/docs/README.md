**_THIS DOCUMENTATION IS OUTDATED AND WILL BE UPDATED ASAP_**

See: https://github.com/wheelroom/wheelroom/issues/26

Example repo on how to use
[@wheelroom/wheelroom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wheelroom/wheelroom) and
[gatsby-theme-wheelroom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-wheelroom)

## Required

This has been developed and tested on macOS. Ubuntu should not give any
problems. Windows has never been tried, there's possibly some unresolved path
issues there. I'd be happy to know.

The boilerplate depends on [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and uses
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

### Services

Currently Wheelroom supports services like:

- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/),
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Plugins

- Contentful content Preview ([TODO: write docs about
  /page-url?preview](./roadmap.md))
