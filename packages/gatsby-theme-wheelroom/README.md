# gatsby-theme-wheelroom

A generic `gatsby-node.js` built on consistent models and fragments, which takes
care of pulling data from Contentful.

Have a look at the [boilerplate](https://github.com/jaccomeijer/wheelroom/tree/master/packages/boilerplate) to so see how to use this.

## Wheelroom

The theme requires graphql queries to be defined. These can be generated by the
[wheelroom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wheelroom/wheelroom) package and the plugin [wheelroom-plugin-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wheelroom/wheelroom-plugin-graphql).

Wheelroom is a tool for managing content models. It was designed to populate a
headless CMS like contentful, generate graphql and generate boilerplate code.

## Query types

The theme can handle three query types:

- page: pages have a path which is used to create the actual pages
- subPage: subPages have a slug from which the path is created
- global: global data is added to every page

## Install

Install the plugin by adding it to your `gatsby-config.js`

```javascript
// Wheelroom generated files with graphql
const articleQuery = require('./src/graphql/article-query')
const globalsQuery = require('./src/graphql/globals-query')
const pageQuery = require('./src/graphql/page-query')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      options: {
        defaultLocale: 'en-US',
        pageTemplate: path.resolve('./src/page-template.tsx'),
        queries: [articleQuery, globalsQuery, pageQuery],
      },
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-wheelroom`,
    },
...
```
